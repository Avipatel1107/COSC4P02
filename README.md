Project Description:

We aim to develop an application that generates an optimal academic schedule tailored to each student’s goals. Its primary objective is to help students make informed decisions about their academic paths, reducing difficulty, stress, and uncertainty. Course Mix will serve as a personal, on-demand academic advisor, supporting students throughout their university journey.

Project Solution:

Course Mix provides Brock University students with a comprehensive hub for academic planning. The app serves as a one-stop destination, providing users with a centralized platform to view courses, access planning details, and receive personalized suggestions. Features include insights into course difficulty, recommended course loads, and customized schedules. Course Mix functions as a 24/7 academic advisor, giving students greater control over their academic journey and helping them achieve better results aligned with their goals.
