Project Description:

We aim to develop an application that creates personalized academic schedules tailored to each student’s goals, starting with a focus on computer science students. If time allows, we plan to expand to other programs. The primary objective of Course Mix is to allow students to make informed decisions about their academic journeys, reducing stress, uncertainty, and challenges. By serving as a personal, on-demand academic advisor, Course Mix will guide students every step of the way throughout their university experience.

Project Solution:

Course Mix provides Brock University students with a comprehensive hub for academic planning. The app serves as a one-stop destination, providing users with a centralized platform to view courses, access planning details, and receive personalized suggestions. Features include insights into course difficulty, recommended course loads, and customized schedules. Course Mix functions as a 24/7 academic advisor, giving students greater control over their academic journey and helping them achieve better results aligned with their goals.
