Project Description:

We aim to provide computer science students with an application that generates an optimal schedule tailored towards helping them achieve their academic goals. 
The software’s core objective would be to make sure students are able to make informed decisions concerning their academic paths in order to mitigate  difficulty, 
stress and uncertainty. Essentially the app is every university student’s handheld advisor, supporting them throughout their academic journey.

Project Solution:

The Course Mix app allows computer science students at Brock to view their courses, planning details, and suggestions in an all in one hub environment. 
Here you will be able to see course difficulties, suggested course loads, suggested schedules, etc. This app will help students to not only have a 
personal academic advisor alternative available 24/7, but also lets students take more control and charge over their academic journey, 
and see better results in line with their academic goals.
